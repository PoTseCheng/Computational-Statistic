## Student Project by Po-Tse Cheng

This project aims to develop a better understanding regarding algorithms of Classification Trees. In particular, theoretical backgrounds will be discussed and simulated data from two separate papers will be utilised to provide evaluation and evidence in support of certain properties. This notebook is written in the following way: Chapter 1 is the introduction. Chapter 2 will cover most of the theoretical sections (Including DGPs) and limitations. In Chapter 3, we will use the established DGPs to evaluate the algorithms. Chapter 4 is the conclusion.
