## Student Project by Po-Tse Cheng

This student project replicates the main results of The Effect of Terrorism on Employment and Consumer Sentiment: Evidence from Successful and Failed Terror Attacks by [Abel Brodeur](https://sites.google.com/site/abelbrodeur/). All of the data used within this paper are made avaliable on the original published [website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160556). The Dataset zip file contains detailed description by the author along with the original [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) code.

This project aim to establish the connection between the research issue and the identification method utilised by the author. It also provides assessment of the identification strategy used by the authors. The replication of the original results includes verification for identifying strategy, channels examination , treatment effect estimations as well as additional robustness checks. My personal contribution mainly focused on complements that complete the original analysis. In addition, I provide extended potential interpretation from Brodeur (2018) that reach consensus with other post-attack analysis papers.
